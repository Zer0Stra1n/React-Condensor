The goals of this project are to create a gallery of movie posters that, upon click, display a modal containing the movie trailer.
A filter should be present that will accept movie titles and reduce the list of posters in the gallery accordingly.

Data will be retrieved from an existing AWS service on the network at this location: https://gtrtoph0d7.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/dev/media
The endpoint will accept an additional id to retrieve trailer information and other pertinent information from the corresponding movie.
